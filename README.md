# Statistics-for-DSAI
Compilation of data analysis and statistical exercise notebooks completed as part of the statistics module
Libraries used across all notebooks include: matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy and sklearn

## London Underground Exits
* Manipulated data using dataframes
* Reviewed data, plotted distributions followed by analysis using descriptive statistics and shapes of distributions
* Notebook written to be presented to readers who are interested in travel patterns

## Texas Bridges
* Prepared data for analysis - notably dealing with missing values, excluding old data, grouping and deriving a current bridge condition score
* Exploratory analysis of data including continuous and categorical variables - correlation matrix, cross-tabulation (with normalisation), histograms and box plots
* Regression modelling to observe the effect of predictor variables on the target (bridge condition)
* Written to be understood by bridge material domain experts

## Property Prices
* Exploratory analyses on the average price of specific property types over a 36 month period in different areas of England
* Merge operations to combine dataframes
* Various time series plots to observe property price trends, with full breakdown
* Chi-square test and p-value interpretation to determine if there was a difference in price between regions

## Storks
* Constructed several regression models to explain the spurious correlation between number of storks in a country and human births
* Computed and interpreted R2 and RMSE parmeters
* Bootstrap technique to estimate confidence intervals, and the distribution of differences in these parameters between models with varying predictors
